Forget Password 
==================

1. we will use their email Id find out that user inside our database.
2. If that user is available, then we will send a token to their email ID and only with that token they can reset the new password will not allow anyone to reset their password.


Signing 
========
- Signing a user Id just like when a user wants to use any private
route will ask them their username and password.
- But asking them every time that username and password is not a good user experience.
- So we are using JWT , we can sign a brand new token whenever a user,since their email and password to us will verify that and we will sign this special token and will send token to our frontend app.
- And whenever a user wants to use any private route then we will, instead of asking their email and password , will ask for this recently token and we will verify this inside our backend.
